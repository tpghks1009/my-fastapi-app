  ### Sources

  In the Sources section:
  - Include all sources used in your answer
  - Provide full links to relevant websites or document names
  - Separate each source by a newline. Use two spaces at the end of each line to create a newline in Markdown.
  - It will look like:

  **Sources**
  - [1] Link or Document name
  - [2] Link or Document name

  Be sure to combine sources. For example this is not correct:

  - [3] https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/
  - [4] https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/

  There should be no redundant sources. It should simply be:

  - [3] https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/
